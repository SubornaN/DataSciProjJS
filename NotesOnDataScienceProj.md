# Main Points for Data Science Project Jump Start

## 1. The Big Picture
- Rarely: Explore for the sake of exploring; model for the sake of modeling.
- Commonly: Use evidence from data to drive decision making and bring value.
- Be able to answer:
  - What is the objective?  
  - Who does the objective appeal to? (Who is the intended audience)
  - What is the value in the objective?
- Every step: Communicate!
  - With the stake holders
  - With the team
  - Within the work itself: let the objective motivate the DA and ML, let the ML help direct the DA, and let the DA help direct the ML.
- At every step ask yourself why are you doing what you're doing, and how does it fit into the big picture objective?

## 2. Clearly Define the Scope
- This is still part of the objective!
- What is the final product, and who are the intended users?
- What are the necessary definitions between data science and domain purposes? (Big example: is there a target variable you're looking at and if so, what is its role in the domain and in your work)
- Is your scope flexible?

## 3. Collection
- Which data might help you achieve your objective?
- Where are those data and how do you need to collect them?
- How will you store the data?
- How will you update the data repo if necessary?

## 4. Data Analysis
- Relating to the original objective, which includes if you are going to build a model, what are the analyses that need to be considered and conducted?
- What visualizations might help communicate insights to you and others? How will you produce those visualizations?
- If applicable, how does your model inform the analysis that you should do?
- What valuations can you give to your analysis? You should be able to clearly state why you conducted the analysis you did and what value it has the potential to bring (even if that potential is simply helping inform other analyses, you should be able to clearly understand that).
- Have you put together an analysis framework which allows for you to update and explore in the communication cycle? If not, do so!

## 5. Model Building (if applicable)
- What is the purpose of the model and how does it relate to the original objective?
- Are there several models for you to consider which might help you reach the objective, if so, can you list them out and explain why they would be useful?
- From the candidate models, what is the appropriate way to judge which model is best suited for your objective? Which metrics do you use? How do you translate the success/power/etc of the model into value or valuable information?

## 6. Keep Communicating.
